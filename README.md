# App Description

A simple quistion and answer app that connect to dummy api service (json-server). (self learn purpose). tags: useReducer.

## Goal of this app

- learn about useReducer vs useState
- implement full useReducer
- use json-server as fake api service

## need to improve

- there's some problem this useReducer has setInterval that can trigger re-render all the children every 1 second. I will improve it later.
